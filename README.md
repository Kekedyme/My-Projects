Mobile Front-End Development Project

As part of my university coursework, I developed a responsive and user-friendly front-end for a mobile website designed for Android and iOS platforms. 
The project, done for ITAK (Regional Dance Centre of Eastern Finland), a dance group in Kuopio, Finland focused on delivering an intuitive user experience, optimized layout, and smooth navigation tailored for smartphone users.
